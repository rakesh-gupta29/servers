    "description": "From being elected as Congress president in 1929 till his death in 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru remained a towering figure in Indian politics, a man who left an indelible stamp on the history of South Asia. As a leading light of the nationalist struggle and as India's first and longest-serving prime minister, his ideas shaped the political contours of the country and left an imprint so deep that his legacy continues to be debated furiously today.In life, as in afterlife, Nehru was many things to many people. Going beyond the imposed labels of contemporary discourse, this book illuminates four encounters that Nehru had with contemporaries from across the political spectrum - Muhammad Iqbal, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Sardar Patel and Syama Prasad Mookerjee - that are critical to understanding his ideas, and his long afterlife and impress on the present. Nehru may no longer be alive to answer his critics today, but there was a time when he pitted himself vigorously against his opponents in the marketplace of ideas, debating the most profound questions in South Asian history and decisively influencing political events. It is this intellectually combative Nehru whom we meet in this book - voicing ideological disagreements, forging political alliances, moulding political opinion, offering visions of the future and staking out the political field - a key figure in the debates that defined India",

Despite being unloved by his people, mistrusted by his party, and ruling under the shadow of 10 Janpath, Rao transformed the economy and ushered India into the global arena. With exclusive access to Raos never-before-seen personal papers and diaries, this definitive biography provides new revelations on the Indian economy, nuclear programme, foreign policy and the Babri Masjid. Tracing his early life from a small town in Telangana through his years in power, and finally, his humiliation in retirement, it never loses sight of the inner man, his difficult childhood, his corruption and love affairs, and his lingering loneliness. Meticulously researched and brutally honest, this landmark political biography is a must-read for anyone interested in knowing about the man responsible for transforming India.",

Its radical approach foregoes the chronological approach to art movements in favour of looking at the ways in which art has been understood.  he editors investigate the main developments in art interpretation and draw examples from a wide range of genres including painting, sculpture, photography, installation and performance art. his second edition has been fully updated to include many more examples of recent art practice, as well as an expanded glossary and comprehensive marginal notes providing definitions of key terms. Extensively illustrated with a wide range of visual examples, Modern Art is the essential textbook for students of art history.",

Originally entitled first impressions, the novel was rejected, revised, retitled, and finally published--anonymously--in 1813, only four years before austen's untimely death. In pride and prejudice, austen calls on her sharp observations of vanity, venality, pomposity, and downright nuttiness in a story about a respectable but far from wealthy family full of daughters--girls who desperately need to find husbands if they are to have any kind of economic security. The eldest of the bennett family, elizabeth, is a bright, opinionated, and complacent young woman whose reaction to an offer of marriage from her wealthy but impossibly arrogant suitor, fitzwilliam darcy, is revulsion.",

    "description": "the first book of a comprehensive trilogy, explores the influence of European 'colonial consciousness' (or 'coloniality'), in particular its religious and racial roots, on Bharat as the successor state to the Indic civilisation and the origins of the Indian Constitution. It lays the foundation for its sequels by covering the period between the Age of Discovery, marked by Christopher Columbus' expedition in 1492, and the reshaping of Bharat through a British-made constitution-the Government of India Act of 1919. This includes international developments leading to the founding of the League of Nations by Western powers that tangibly impacted this journey. <br> <br>Further, this work also traces the origins of seemingly universal constructs such as 'toleration', 'secularism' and 'humanism' to Christian political theology. Their subsequent role in subverting the indigenous Indic consciousness through a secularized and universalized Reformation, that is, constitutionalism, is examined. It also puts forth the concept of Middle Eastern coloniality, which preceded its European variant and allies with it in the context of Bharat to advance their shared antipathy towards the Indic worldview. In order to liberate Bharat's distinctive indigeneity, 'decoloniality' is presented as a civilizational imperative in the spheres of nature, religion, culture, history, education, language and, crucially, in the realm of constitutionalism.",

    "description": "<br>arendra Modi, the BJP's prime ministerial candidate, is powerful, popular and controversial. With the general elections due to conclude in May 2014, Modi's campaign rallies have drawn unprecedented crowds. Yet, the man remains an enigma. His supporters regard him as the visionary, decisive leader India needs today. His detractors see him as a polarizing fi gure. Is Modi authoritative or authoritarian? Decisive or divisive? A team player or a loner?ndy Marino recorded interviews with Narendra Modi during more than half-a-dozen exclusive meetings - unprecedented access to a very private man. What emerged is this riveting, objective biography of a man who could be India's prime minister. Not shying away from the controversies that have dogged Narendra Modi, including the Gujarat riots and questions about the Gujarat model of governance and development, this political biography provides an unbiased account of possibly the most important figure in Indian politics today. Marino records hour-by-hour details of the 2002 Gujarat riots, presenting a balanced analysis of that raw wound on India's polity. It also reveals hitherto unpublished, authenticated documents, which makes this one of the most important books of 2014.he author analyses Narendra Modi's values, the people who shaped his thinking and the sort of national leader he will make. Personal details of Modi's early life, his wanderings in the Himalayas between the ages of seventeen and nineteen, his rise through the political ranks, his vision for India and his personal philosophy on religion and politics are revealed in a book that is lucid, fast-paced and readable. Narendra Modi: A Political Biography is an insightful, exhaustive and impeccably researched account of the ascent of a political leader.<br>",

    "description": "an a 40-verse hymn provide the solution to all your problems in this lifetime and beyond?<br> Why do millions of devotees recite this hymn whenever they are fearful of the unknown?<br> Hanuman Chalisa, a devotional hymn in praise of the Vanar or Monkey God Hanuman, may appear to be a mere chant which someone can recite in about two minutes. Each verse, however, conveys a much deeper message, which is described in this book: verse by verse.<br> Consider this anecdote. Lord Rama sent Hanuman to the netherworld (Pataal-Lok) to fetch his ring that he claimed had fallen down. As Hanuman reached there and was searching for the ring, he requested the king of the netherworld, the serpent Vasuki, to help him. Vasuki led him to a massive mountain of identical rings.<br> A surprised Hanuman requested Vasuki to help him find the actual ring. Vasuki told him about the circle of life wherein all the four yugas or eras (satya-yuga, treta-yuga, dwapar-yuga and kal-yuga) repeat in a periodic manner. Every treta-yuga in the past had a Lord Rama and Hanuman, and in future would also have the same. The mountain of rings is actually infinite for there is no beginning or end to this circle of life.<br> Hanuman finally understood the purpose of his visit and returned to Ayodhya, expecting not to find Lord Rama there but assured that Lord Rama would be born again in future, in the next treta-yuga. <br> Similar to the above mentioned story and the message, many other hidden pearls of wisdom and knowledge conveyed in Hanuman Chalisa are lucidly explained in this book.",

The story of Boses life is of absorbing interest, and the author makes him live in all his idealism, fiery nationalism, political astuteness and overriding arrogance. But more important are its implications, which must make the reader seriously rethink the role of European-Asian relations and, in rethinking, arrive at a better understanding of what is happening now and what may happen.",

    "description": "\"FROM THE AUTHOR OF THE BESTSELLING BIOGRAPHIES OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN AND ALBERT EINSTEIN, THIS IS THE EXCLUSIVE BIOGRAPHY OF STEVE JOBS. Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when societies around the world are trying to build digital-age economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple\\'s hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values\"--",

    "description": "India's greatest film-maker on the art and craft of films Exactly fifty years ago, in 1955, the release of Pather Panchali heralded the arrival of a master in the world of cinema. Over the next forty years, Satyajit Ray came to be regarded as one of the world's finest film-makers ever. Today, more than a decade after his death, he continues to be India's most respected name in international film circles. Apart from his achievements as a director, Ray was also a prolific writer of novels, short stories, and essays on cinema. Speaking of Films brings together some of Ray's most memorable writings on film and film-making. With the masterly precision and clarity that characterize his films, Ray discusses a wide array of subjects: the structure and language of cinema with special reference to his adaptations of Tagore and Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay, the appropriate use of background music and dialogue in films, the relationship between a film-maker and a film critic, and important develoents in cinema like the advent of sound and colour. He also writes about his own experiences, the challenges of working with rank amateurs, and the innovations called for when making a film in the face of technological, financial and logistical constraints. In the process, Ray provides fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpses of the people who worked with him\"the intricacies of getting Chhabi Biswas, who had no ear for music, to play a patron of classical music in Jalsaghar; the incredible memory of the seventy-five-year-old Chunibala Devi, Indir Thakrun of Pather Panchali, and her remarkable attention to details. This first-ever translation of Bishay Chalachitra, a seminal collection of essays on cinema, Speaking of Films retains the lucidity and simplicity that is a hallmark of Ray's writing, and gives an invaluable insight into the mind of a genius.",

Her heart remains unhealednine months later her former  girlfriend, Molly Nelson, is still not speaking to her. Worst of all,  that wound was self-inflicted. <br><br>Trying to move on, Ari turns to  private investigator Biz Stone for solace. When her best friend Jane  arrives with a disquieting story of a dead social worker and murky  motives for murder in California, Ari naturally asks Biz to go with  them. Molly, meanwhile, would do anything to prove that Biz is a lowlife  who spiked Mollys police career, murdered a witness and most  definitely stole her girlfriend. <br><br>Betrayals of more than one kind  form the tightening net of danger that surrounds Ari in this fourth  installment of Ann Roberts critically acclaimed series.",
